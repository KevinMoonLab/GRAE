GRAE
==============================
Source code for the Geometry Regularized Autoencoder paper. 

Main experiment is available under [src/experiments/main.py](). All embeddings, plots and tables
are saved in the results directory. 

Based on the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07142). Additionally, a brief explanation about this method can be found in `GRAE_poster.pdf`. If you use this code, please cite the following:
